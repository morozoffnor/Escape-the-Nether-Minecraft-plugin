# Escape the Nether

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d569e7302c42446c8bc16671852efb44)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/morozoffnor/Escape-the-Nether-Minecraft-plugin?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=morozoffnor/Escape-the-Nether-Minecraft-plugin&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

 This is a Spigot plugin which just teleports anyone who joins the server into the Nether. The point is that in Minecraft 1.16 you could escape the Nether starting with literally nothing. So this is it. Escape the Nether and sleep in the bed otherwise you will be teleported back when you join next time.
 ### [Pre-release](https://github.com/morozoffnor/Escape-the-Nether-Minecraft-plugin/releases/tag/v1.0)
 
 ### Setup
 
 Put `NetherSpawn` into your `plugins` folder and restart the server.
 
 **Be aware of conflicts that might occur if you're using any plugins which teleport or do something with worlds/dimentions.**
